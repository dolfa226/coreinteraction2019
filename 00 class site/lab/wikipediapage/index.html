                The English <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire"> satirist </a> and editorial cartoonist 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hogarth"> William Hogarth</a>, who emerged In the 18th century, 
                has been credited with pioneering Western sequential art. His work ranged from realistic portraiture 
                to comic strip-like series of pictures called "modern moral subjects". Much of his work poked fun at 
                contemporary politics and customs; illustrations in such style are often referred to as "Hogarthian".[
                1] Following the work of Hogarth, political cartoons began to develop in England in the latter part of 
                the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both 
                from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, calling the king 
                (George III), prime ministers and generals to account, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.[2]

                While never a professional cartoonist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin"> Benjamin Franklin </a>is credited with 
                having the first cartoon published in an American newspaper.[3] In the 19th century, professional cartoonists such as 
                Thomas Nast introduced other familiar American political symbols, such as the Republican elephant.[3]

                During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century"> 20th century</a>, numerous magazines carried single-panel gag cartoons by such freelance cartoonists 
                as Charles Addams, Irwin Caplan, Chon Day, Clyde Lamb, and John Norment. These were almost always published in 
                black and white, although Collier's often carried cartoons in color. The debut of Playboy introduced full-page 
                color cartoons by Jack Cole, Eldon Dedini, Roy Raymonde and others. Single-panel cartoonists syndicated to
                newspapers included Dave Breger, Hank Ketcham, George Lichty, Fred Neher, Irving Phillips, and J. R. Williams.
