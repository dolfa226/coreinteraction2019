        <h1>Reading 3</h1>
        
<h3>“Kameelah Janan Rasheed on Research and Archiving”</h3>
<p>Collecting allows you to discover and stumble upon new ideas. Collecting for research shouldn’t be seen as something you have to go to the library for. Anything can be collected and should be collected because it still is information. </p>

<h3>“Rutherford Chang on the Art of Collection”</h3>
<p>Chang believes collecting is important because each object as different from one another. There could be 1 million notebooks that are created identical but each one will travel on its own and be shaped and molded. They’ll all be different based on how people and environment interacted despite it being the same, initial product. </p>

<h3>“Ordinary Plenty”</h3>
<p>Having the ability to preserve information online should be taken advantage of even if the information seems to be mundane. Jeremy Keith views each entity, whether its a book or a song, as important. Collecting these items is important because each item is important depending on the audience.</p>

<h3>Ideas</h3>
<p>Some ideas I’ve been thinking about are </p>
<ul>-collecting receipts</ul>
<ul>-first thought after waking up</ul>
<ul>-tasks each day that I’ve kept recorded in agenda books </ul>
<p>After reading the “Ordinary Plenty,” I’ve realized that even our thoughts, posts and words can be collected. Prior, I thought that collecting should be something that is more tangible and physical.
