        <p><h3>What Happens When You Create A Flexbox?</h3>
When you create a flex box, you are putting the items with the attribute display: flex or display: inline flex in a bigger flex block container. The items inside the container behave depending on the flex-direction. Flex direction has four values: row, row-reverse, column, and column-reverse. Justify-content defines the main-axis alignment and alignment of the items. The values for justify content are flex-start, flex-end, center, space-around, space-between and space-evenly. Items can also be made smaller or bigger through flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis. Overall, creating a flexbox is about the organization of attributes given in a block container. It uses different properties to determine the direction and size of the items. </p>

<p><h3>What Do We Mean When We Say Responsive?</h3>
The word responsive is not easily defined. Throughout the article, the author does not directly denote the word. Responsive web design can be defined as creating layouts that adapt to different browser sizes by the resizing of images and reorganizing of items. But responsive also has a conceptual meaning. How does a design interact with a user and how can it be easier for a user to consume? I believe responsive can be easily defined from a technical stand point. Thinking about it conceptually is more difficult because it poses the question of what is the best design for the user.</p>
