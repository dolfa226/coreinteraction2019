        <h1>Research & Destory</h1>
        <p>1. The value and effort used in graphic design is often overlooked. Designers work endlessly to create work that appears to be seamlessly created; as if the poster or website just happened. It is through this amount of time and research that ideas and messages are shared. This poses the question from the start of the reading of whether design is necessary or if it is an “added value.”</p>
        <p>2. Graphic design has often been viewed to be a commercially driven job. But design can personally express the designer’s own ideas. “Today, an ‘important graphic design’ is one generated by the designer himself, a commentary in the margins of visual culture.” Graphic design brings meaning, personality and depth to a message.
