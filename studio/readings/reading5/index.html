<p>“In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity” Anil Dash. Today it is very easy for anyone to have a website especially with the services of SquareSpace and Wix. Often times though, these websites look all the same, with the clean typefaces and grids. The reading serves a reminder to think about sites from the mid 1990s where the focus was on creating instead of a commercial motive. </p>

<p>There should definitely be spaces where people can create without outside influences. But its also difficult to separate from commercial work especially as a working designer. Sometimes, it’s just commercial work and needs to be done in a specific way. </p>
