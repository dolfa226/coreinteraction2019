        <h1>Reading 7</h1>
        <p> 1. Time is a network similar to how websites are a network. It's an independent quanity in how we schedule our lives around time but it is interdependent on each other (ex. sending a message requires that the two points agree on the time)</p>
        <p> 2. - “If you can’t experience it, it does not exist”  </p>
        <p> If people experience time each moment, how can we define experimental moments as seconds, minutes, hour, days etc. if experiences are all relative? At the same time, time should also be seen as a scientific entity (ex. circadian rhythm, sleep cycle)
