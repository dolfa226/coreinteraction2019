        <p>It's interesting how Schwulst discusses how individuals should create websites for themselves so the web is not overwhelmed
            by Facebook and Google. It reflects how websites can be flexible in what it depicts and be unique and personal to each 
            person.
        </p>
        
        <p>Schwulst compares plants to websites. Websites can't be rushed and may not grow and develop as quickly as you would expect
            similarly to how the creative process can work. When should a designer stop and move on with a project.  </p>
